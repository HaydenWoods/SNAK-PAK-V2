Views and Subviews
- Create views which can have subviews
- Every view can be both a sub view and a view
- This is handled by each view having sub views that are not unique to that singular view, in this way you can import different views into a master view that you can then rearrange those views into a relevant organisation.

Protocol Buffers
- Use google protocol buffers to store data in files
- Advantages
	- Non-human readable
	- Non-human editable
	- Customisable data type
	- Faster read and write times
	- Integrates properly with C# objects and classes, dont 	need to integrate a JSON parser or anyother data reader 	that might be needed for other data storage techniques

Active Directory Integration
- Use the active directory to get most of the information for the program
- This will allow me to show lots of data such as last user logged into a computer and much more

Active Directory Searching/Filtering
- Instead of just loading in all of the computers from a file I will instead have a list on the side that you can filter via
	- String searches
	- Asset type (Computer, Laptop)
	- Location
	- Others...
- Once you have filtered you can either choose which ones you want to add via the add button on the right of each search result or you can simple add all from the search results

Bulk Actions on Views
- Able to perform bulk actions on a view by right clicking on the views object that contains all the subviews and picking a command
- There will always be a prompt when doing this to ensure that the user is not doing a bulk command accidentally, can be more dangerous if you force shutdown all computers in ICT1.
